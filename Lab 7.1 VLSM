In this lab we translated a subnetting table to a network in packet tracer

Troubleshooting:
when I try to enter broadcast ip values into the router it tells me that /21 is a bad mask for 172.16.7.255.
i learned that i should not be using broadcast addresses for default gateways, instead i should use a host IP

setting the default gateway and ip adresses of the serial connections gave me the most trouble
