Summary
Set up a network with 3 routers, 2 workstations per router connected with switches, configure serial ports, 
configure rip, and send pings to computers connected to different routers.

CLI commands
set router ip and subnet mask:
#interface GigabitEthernet0/0/0
#ip address 192.168.1.33 255.255.255.224

Turn on router interface
#no shutdown

RIP needs to advertize the network
example, 192.168.1.0

In CLI this looks like:
#router rip
#network 192.168.1.0

Serial port config:
in serial interface, set ip to next usable address, set clock speed to 64000 and turn on the port

In CLI this looks like:
#interface Serial0/1/0
#ip address 192.168.1.97 255.255.255.224

I had no difficulties with this lab
