Set up a simple network with 2 networks and observed http packets using simulation mode

I was stuck for a long time trying to figure out why the router was not connecting to the switches, I found out that it was because the ports on the router were turned off.

Document the use of "Simulation Mode"

simulation mode stops time and allows user to watch each step of a packet being sent across the network. 
To navigate the steps there are buttons at the bottom of packet tracer that can move to the next step.
On the right side of packet tracer there is a panel with more information about the steps the packets take that you can click on for information.
