// How do networks work?
Similar to postal mail service

Packet is a unit of data transfer

DNS converts champlain.edu -> 17.15.129.51

Add headers to data

Send packet to network interface controller (NIC)

Transmits onto network Send to local router, default gateway

Post office sorts letters to get closer to recipient

Router sends packet to the next router IP 1 which network it belongs to, 2 identifies machine

Routing table

// What do you need to run a network
Network connectivity Devices need an IP address and a Mac address assigned to NIC physical address similar to zipcode Mac address is similar to street address Logical Addressing Routing, post offices Numbers and Names

// Intro to OSI Model
Open systems interconnection is a network protocol framework that uses 7 Layers When starting creating data on a system and you want to send it you need to go through 7 layers to make sure the information is sent OSI Model can help troubleshoot where the data went The OSI model reads from bottom to top Top to bottom - All people seem to need data processing Bottom to top - Please do not throw sausage pizza away

// Letter Analogy and OSI
Layer 7 Application layer Network - the data the computer is sending Not common to find issues here

Layer 6 Presentation layer Network: how is the data formatted and presented to the user (encrypted, encoded, zipped)

Layer 5 Session layer Session setup and teardown

Transport layer 4 Network: port number, how data is sent and received Port numbers tell receiver what application the data is for 80 http web traffic 443 https 425 smtp simple mail transfer protocol Email 22 ssh remotely access computers

Layer 3 Network Layer IP addresses if sender and receiver

Layer 2 Data link Defines how the packets get onto the media Is the session available When is it safe to send, is there an active connection

Layer 1 Physical layer Physically sends the data over media Copper wires Fiber optic Radio waves

// OSI
helps narrow down problems Computer programming - verify many steps yourself Tech vendors refer to OSI layers

// Network Protocols
Why do we use a layered model? Why isn't there 1 universal model? Wireless vs wired work environments What happens when addressing changes (IPv4 to IPv6)

IPv4 xxx.xxx.xxx.xxx xxx = 0-255

IPv6 yy:yy:yy:yy:yy:yy:yy y = 0-9, A-F


Layered model / Benefits of the OSI Model Helps with complexity Troubleshoot issues more effectively Concentrate at 1 aspect of communication at a time Helps organize Assists in protocol design, a defined interface to the layers above and below Fosters Competition to advance technology Prevents technology or capability changes in one layer from affecting other layers Provides a common language

Data link refers to mac addresses Network is IP

TCP and UDP are protocols TCP is more common

Applications HTTP, FTP, Email, DNS

// Types of networks
There are some common acronyms used to broadly define “types of networks”

PAN personal area

WAN wide area network

MAN metropolitan area network

LAN local area network

Types are not definitions, but do help us describe networks and relevant technologies

And, as technologies evolve, these type definitions also evolve:

Nanoscale Near field Body Personal Near me Local Campus Metro Regional

// Local Area Network
Two most common, Ethernet Protocol and standards used for “wired” communications

WiFi

Bus topology, coaxial cable daisy chaining devices together

Pros: Simple less cable

Cons: a break anywhere would affect all devices

Ring topology Not commonly used on LANs May be found in factories and other specialized networks

Mesh topology Heavily connected

pros: Very redundant Fault tolerant

Cons: Complicated and lots of cables

Star topology
Very common in modern LANs

Pros: Cable break effects 1 node Nodes don't have to share a cable

Cons: Lots of cables If central device fails, network is down

Star mesh hybrid topology

Balance of efficiency and redundancy

Star is used to connect user devices

// Packet tracer
Get in the habit of saving your packet tracer files

There are lots of tips and tricks for packet tracer

control click to keep a wire selected

// MAC address
How is the destination and source addresses determined within a LAN?

NIC card determines the destination and source address

6 bits or 12 hexadecimal digits

E.g. 33:c4:d8:90:e2:fb

aa:bb:cc:11:22:33

Base 16, 16 digits to represent 1 number

A byte (8 bits in Binary)

Hexadecimal - base 16

1 byte = 2 hex digits

0110 1010 - 1 byte - 2 hex bits

First 6 digits are used to identify the vendor and the last are unique to the device

00-AA-00 intel 00-00-86 Megahertz

MAC address used by NIC to send information from 1 device to the next

3 components to a network address Network ID: first part of IP Address Host ID: second part Mac Address:

IP address is a 32 bit number that is typically displayed like so: xxx.xxx.xxx.xxx Binary IP address: |10000001|10101010|00010010|11011100|

Contains network ID and Host ID Network ID can vary in length Host ID is whatever is leftover Subnet Mask defines how many bits are in the Network ID

// Routing

• Routers are devices that transfer packets between different
networks
- IP network uses the Net ID portion of the IP address to identify the specific
Network

• Having no routers would be like having no Post Offices.
- There would only be only 1 zip code for the entire network
- All systems would be in the same Broadcast Domain
- So, broadcast protocols like ARP would go to all systems

Routers inspect the Layer 3 header of packets
• Makes decisions based on the IP network address information in
the packet

• Switching is Layer 2
- Look at Layer 2 headers and monitor the MAC address
- Switches keep track of MAC addresses and the ports they are on
- Will forward packets to the appropriate port based on MAC

• Routing is Layer 3
- Builds table of Network IDs and the IP of the next router in that direction
- Inspects packets for NetID of IP address and forwards to next router on the way
- Does not need to know the whole path- just next router!

• At a minimum, router tables need to have:
- Network Address: The address of a network
- Subnet Mask: The subnet mask for that network – so it knows how many bits
are in the Net ID
- Next Hop: IP address of a neighboring router it can send the packet it to to
reach the network
- Interface: Which of the routers own physical interfaces it can send the packet
out of to reach the Next Hop


• May also contain other data like distance (how many hops to the
network) and preference if there are more than one entries for same
route

Default Route –
or Gateway of Last Resort
• Routers can also add a “Default Route” to their table
• This route will be used by default if the destination network is not
in the table
• This is commonly used to send all Internet traffic to ISP
• That way, routers on a network like Champlain only need to know
the internal Champlain network addresses
• All other network can be sent to the ISP

How are Routing Tables Built
• Direct Connection: Automatically added to table
• Static:
- Network admins can type them into the router configuration
- e.g.: ip route 192.168.4.0 255.255.255.0 192.168.3.2 FA0/1
- Does not scale well – Imagine having to do that for 100’s of networks on
dozens of routers!
• Dynamic:
- Use protocols so that the routers can send routing table information to
their neighbors! More on this later

Routing Tables
• At a minimum, router tables need to have:
- Network Address: The address of a network
- Subnet Mask: The subnet mask for that network – so it knows how many bits
are in the Net ID
- Next Hop: IP address of a neighboring router it can send the packet it to to
reach the network
- Interface: Which of the routers own physical interfaces it can send the packet
out of to reach the Next Hop
• May also contain other data like distance (how many hops to the
network) and preference if there are more than one entries for same
route

- e.g.: ip route 192.168.4.0 255.255.255.0 192.168.3.2 FA0/1
- Does not scale well – Imagine having to do that for 100’s of networks on
dozens of routers!

• Dynamic:
- Use protocols so that the routers can send routing table information to
their neighbors

Routing Protocols allow
routers to “talk” to each other
• Dynamic/automatic creation of
tables

Routing Protocols
• Routing protocols are just that – protocols!
• Routers use the protocols to send info (packets) to one another
about networks and how to access them
• Routers use the info to build their routing tables

Routing Protocols
• Routers use “routing protocols” to exchange routing information
with each other
- IGP is used to refer to the process running on routers inside an
organization’s network
- EGP is used to refer to the process running between routers bordering
directly connected ISP networks


What Is an IGP?
• Interior Gateway Protocol
• Within an Organization
• Carries information about internal infrastructure prefixes
• Widely used IGPs:
- RIPv2
- OSPF
- ISIS

What Is an EGP?
• Exterior Gateway Protocol
• Used to convey routing information between Organizations
• De-coupled from the IGP
• Current widely-use EGP is BGP (Border Gateway Protocol)

Why Do We Need an EGP?
• Scaling to large network
- Hierarchy
- Limit scope of failure
• Define Administrative Boundary
• Policy
- Control reachability of prefixes
- Merge separate organizations
- Connect multiple IGPs

Dynamic IGP Types
Distance Vector- Like RIP v2!
• Routers send out broadcasts/multicasts with their routing table
• Other routers listen, and update their tables accordingly
• Typically send tables every 30-60 seconds
• Routing preference is based solely on Hops (how many routers between
networks)
• Very easy to configure – great for simple/smaller networks – but...
• Noisy (lot’s of broadcasts), slow to converge, does not scale to large or
complex networks

Configuring RIPv2
On Cisco Routers, configuring RIPv2 is pretty simple:
1. Enable RIP by using the router rip global config command
- R1(config)# router rip
2. Instruct the router to use RIPv2 with the version 2 command
- R1(config-router)# version 2
3. Telling RIP which connected networks to advertise by using one
or more network commands.
- R1(router-config)#network 192.168.3.0
- R1(router-config)#network 192.168.1.0

Link State IGP
Alternative to Distance Vector protocols like RIP
• More popular method for IGP
• Routers figure out who their neighbors
• After initial convergence – only send Hello’s (keep-alives) and Link State
updates with changes
• Uses more advanced route-selection metrics (notably – bandwidth)
• Open Shortest Path First (OSPF) is most popular IGP
• You will cover OSPF more in future classes!
