In this packet tracer lab we were given a disconnected network with three floors and were tasked with creating three seperate VLANs to seperate network traffic into these three channels

I did not need any troubleshooting for this lab

Entry for creating VLANs on a switch
VLAN database, add VLAN
Name VLAN can be anything
Number has to be connected to the name and stay the same across switches

Entry for configuring an interface as an Access port
Select port such as fastEthernet0/1
Select VLAN dropdown
Select desired VLAN

Entry for configuring an interface as a Trunk port
Select port such as GigabitEthernet0/1
Change Access to Trunk
Select VLAN dropdown and select all of the VLANs you would like to come through the port
