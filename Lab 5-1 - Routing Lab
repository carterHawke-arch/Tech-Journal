In this lab we created a network with 3 seperate networks, pinged across the network and used a sniffer to get information about the packets being sent.

No troubleshooting needed.

How did you connect to a router?
we first turned off the router to add ports so there were enough connections for the devices we will be connecting. then we used copper straight through wire to connect
devices to a switch, and a copper straight through wire to connect the switch to the router. for the devices that were connected directly to the router, we used copper 
cross through wire.

note
192.168 is a class C address and uses /24 or 255.255.255.0 subnet mask
